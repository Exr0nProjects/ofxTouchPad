Access raw multi-touch device data on OSX 10.5 or greater.

Requires `MultitouchSupport.framework` to be included in the project.

In OSX 10.5-10.8 this can be found in `/System/Library/Frameworks/MultitouchSupport.framework`

In OSX 10.9+ this can be found in `/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/MultitouchSupport.framework`

For openFrameworks 0.9.0+, the Xcode project files (including the private framework) can be generated using the Project Generator.
