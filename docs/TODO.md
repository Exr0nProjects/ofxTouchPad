# TODO
-   Update work to include research @ [hammerspoon_asm.undocumented](https://github.com/asmagill/hammerspoon_asm.undocumented/).
-   Make connection API more flexible.  Currently connects to default device (usually the trackpad), but the code also supports multi-touch with Apple Magic Mouse and external trackpads.  Currently when creating an instance, it automatically connects to device `0`. Connecting to a different index also works.
